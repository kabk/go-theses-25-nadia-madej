				<h2 id="abstract"> </br> </br> </br> Abstract </h2> 
				<p>
					This thesis is an exploration of the notion of <em> collective crafting </em> among women, and its influence 
					on the community and the sense of belonging. How does it affect the feeling of empowerment of the individual? 
					How does making things together bring people closer to each other? Why do we create group structures and how 
					do they influence us?
				</p>

				<p>
					I begin this thesis by defining the meaning of collectivity and craft and contextualising these notions within 
					broader historical narratives. In this process, I draw on Silvia Federici’s “Witches, Witch-Hunting, and Women” 
					to reflect on the position of women in society. I continue by taking a closer look at an essay “The Storyteller” 
					by Walter Benjamin which portrays crafting as a way of processing memory, knowledge production as well as a means 
					of an intergenerational exchange of experiences. Lastly, I focus on a case study from the Polish countryside, 
					which illustrates how collective crafting helps to preserve local culture and connect generations of women.

				<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

				<p>
					I feel that collectivity has been a theme in my life since I was a small child. Growing up with two sisters 
					made me feel like I could always count on their company. Though I had a strong sense of independence from 
					a very young age, I always felt the need to have them around. Being around my sisters gave me a sense of belonging. 
					I could be honest and feel appreciated exactly as I was. Growing up together meant constantly rediscovering both 
					ourselves and each other. Every year we grew, changed and adapted. We would support each other, exchange experiences 
					and cheer each other’s successes. It was always a collective effort.
				</p>

				<p>
					<em> As I understand it, a collective is a group of people that shares a common goal and motivation. It is based on mutual 
						support of members of the group. It creates a space of trust and belonging, which enables and facilitates pursuing the shared objective.    </em>
				</p>

				<p>
					Looking back, I think that our shared activities were the moments which really gave us space to connect. Going for walks, 
					playing, drawing or making things with playdough allowed us not only to get closer, but also develop confidence in expressing 
					our ideas and, paradoxically, by positioning ourselves in a group, strengthen our autonomy. Some might think that it created 
					a sense of competition among us, I would say it was the opposite. It made us realise that each has a unique way of being, creating and crafting.
				</p>

				<p>
					<em> Crafting means making something with your hands, exercising a skill. Craft, ‘Cræft’ from Old English, means strength, 
						skill <sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-1" href="#fn-1">[1]</a></sup></em>
				</p>

				<p>
					I believe that this base of trust and safety influenced me a lot as a person. It boosted my confidence and made me 
					realise what my strengths are and what influence they have on others. I felt empowered.  
				</p>

				<p>
					Once a group of people who share a trust in each other starts spending time together by making something with their hands, 
					I believe all criteria are met to call the happening collective crafting. Me spending time with my sisters certainly 
					qualifies as such hap-pening and countless other examples can be found all around such as meeting up with a group of 
					friends to cook dinner together. For something to be a collective undertaking, there is no need to organise it under 
					any specific directive. No organisation or institution is necessary to ‘approve’ these actions nor to confirm their 
					existence. It is the pure act of being together that makes it valid. <br>
					&emsp;&emsp;Hopefully, what happens when people start crafting collectively is a moment of togetherness, support and creativity. 
					We slowly start to let go of any outside expectations, shyness, doubts about ourselves and start to feel free and 
					connected to the people around us. I believe that while everyone is busy with the making, that’s when the most beautiful 
					interaction happens—the conversation. It is an exchange of thoughts, experiences and knowledge. <br>
					&emsp;&emsp;Being physically together allows us to get closer to each other on a different level. When we are together, new memories 
					are made and new bonds created, not only through the act of processing the information we exchange in spoken word, but also 
					through all the other senses that are engaged in the process. Our sense of smell—noticing what perfume the other people are 
					wearing that day or our sense of touch—interacting with different materials. I believe that especially in the era of social 
					media, where increasingly many of our interactions happen online, it may be even more important to reflect on the role of 
					these moments of physical connection. <br>
					&emsp;&emsp;In this thesis I would like to further explore not only the role that collectivity plays in our everyday lives, but also 
					how it can influence and enhance the act of creating both physical and intangible cultural artefacts. I would also like to 
					take a closer look at the position that women take in these groups and collective activities, and how these could influence 
					their sense of belonging as well as feeling of empowerment.

				<h2 id="chapter-1">Me vs Us</h2>

				<p>
					According to The Smithsonian Institution <sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-2" href="#fn-2">[2]</a></sup> the human 
					is a social animal. The article on human origins states that grouping, forming relationships and supporting each 
					other is a key to survival, or at least, it used to be. As explained by the author, back in the day, when the only 
					food available to humans were the plants they gathered or the meat they hunted, and the only source of warmth was 
					the fire, being a loner was not an option. The Smithsonian Institution states that becoming a member of a social 
					group was essential to survival—without the help of others there was a risk of not getting enough food or warmth. 
					The article states that tasks like organising shelter, hunting bigger animals or taking care of the children were 
					easier achieved with more than one person. Apart from those sheer practicalities, people also relied on each other 
					both for emotional and physical comfort. <br>
					&emsp;&emsp;Nowadays the matter looks somewhat different. Most people are busy with their daily chores, occupied by work and 
					getting more distant from even their closest social circle, in some cases hardly ever trying to be an active member 
					of a larger community. The fact, that our survival is no longer directly dependent on a large group, may have led most 
					of us to thinking, that being part of a community is somewhat redundant. As I see it, this standpoint is fundamentally 
					flawed. Seeing recent geo-political events, like the COVID-19 pandemic or the progressing climate change increasing 
					the risk of disasters <sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-3" href="#fn-3">[3]</a></sup> all over the globe, I am compelled 
					to reconsider my position in the world which surrounds me. In an environment as unbalanced and unpredictable as described above, 
					it is difficult to imagine not having a social safety net to fall onto. <br>
					&emsp;&emsp;As a creative maker studying in an international environment, I see how expanding my closest circle was very valuable 
					both personally and professionally. Being in a group allowed me to create a feeling of safety and togetherness. Spending 
					time together and exchanging ideas helped me stay creative and open to new perspectives. 
					Coming from the art and design field, I wonder if there is a future within this discipline in which a more cooperative 
					form of creativity replaces the independent art practices. What lessons can we learn from the experiences of collectivity 
					and what kind of creative practices are they pointing to? <br>
					&emsp;&emsp;Even though, as a maker I have a tendency to isolate myself (during my process), I see a value in how being a part of a 
					group can change my creative/artistic experience. 
					Ursula Le Guin <sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-4" href="#fn-4">[4]</a></sup> describes the threat of isolating 
					individualism when she presents the ‘hero’ vs the ‘collective’ conflict: <br>
					As Ursula Le Guin presents the ‘hunter’ vs ‘gatherer’ conflict in her essay “The Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction”:
				</p>

				<p>
					<em> “Heroes are powerful. Before you know it, the men and women in the wild-oat patch and their kids and the skills 
						of the makers and the thoughts of the thoughtful and the songs of the singers are all part of it, have all been 
						pressed into service in the tale of the Hero. But it isn't their story. It's his.”  </em>
				</p>

				<p>
					Le Guin critiques the narrative of the Hero, arguing that collective efforts are often overshadowed by individual 
					glorification. I’d like to draw a parallel between that narrative and the process of art making. When an artist 
					produces a new work, it is never truly an isolated, singular piece. It enters a dialogue, a discourse. It relates 
					to other makers, draws inspiration from their ideas and creations.  It also often relates to the artist’s life and 
					events, people they know. Yet there exists a tendency to idolize the individual creator, the maker. As described 
					in an article <sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-5" href="#fn-5">[5]</a></sup> about collective action “It was only 
					during the Renaissance that the uniqueness of the solo artist’s hand began to be prized both culturally and financially, 
					with works of art coming to be valued as true expressions of the matchless qualities of the singular genius.” The 
					emphasis began to be placed on the author (master) and the final work, and not on the process and the dialogue it was 
					creating. <br>
					&emsp;&emsp;A form of an art collective lets one move away from the egocentric view of the ‘hero’ and instead focuses on 
					the process of making and all the people involved. It is based on the rejection of the artist as a ‘genius’, a singular 
					mind. Instead, they rely on the power of a group, exchanging ideas and thoughts to support their goal the best they can.
					It shows that when everyone has their role based on their strengths, the outcome will become more impactful. It lets the 
					participants get closer without creating divisions between them. Once they feel comfortable and confident about their 
					skills without the need of comparing themselves to each other, it helps to create free and deep work. A collective also 
					gives you a possibility to share the responsibilities and at the same time have more time to create and focus on the 
					work itself instead of organising more menial tasks. De Wachter <sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-6" href="#fn-6">[6]</a></sup> 
					comments on collaboration in the following way:
				</p>

				<p> 
					<em>
					“The ability to converse, disagree and hold incompatible views, and yet move beyond conflict towards creation is essential to collaboration. 
					It is a basic human dynamic, one that the Russian literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin (1895–1975) called the ‘dialogic process’. This dynamic 
					yields a conversation that admits and values difference, and lets interlocutors be within and without the group at various times.”  
					</em>
				</p>

				<p>
					That exchange gives the collectives the advantage over the other artists. Constant dialogue over new ideas and 
					creations can quickly help in the development of a project. But could it also disturb the creative process? Let’s 
					not forget that the above-mentioned perspective is not the only possible outcome of a cooperation with someone. 
					Oftentimes it can be a long and frustrating moment full of compromises and feeling of loss. There is no guarantee 
					of success even assuming that the collective is created among people with compatible characters and a common goal 
					(which can already be difficult to fulfil). Lack of clarity regarding responsibilities and roles of the participants 
					or differences in the vision of the results can cause a lot of unpleasant tension. There are many different structures 
					of collectives that can fill most of your needs, such as a duo if a small team is preferred, or a larger group if 
					the preference is not to have too much responsibility.<br>
					&emsp;&emsp;When it comes to these different structures, I believe there is no right way of organising it. Each group functions 
					in a way that is tailored to the specific needs and goals. One example of a community-focused collective is Slaghammers; 
					a feminist collective based in Glasgow, whose goal is to provide a space for the community to learn new skills in metal 
					work and welding. As it is mentioned in their bio <sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-7" href="#fn-7">[7]</a></sup>, the 
					Slaghammers noticed, that the traditional metal workshop spaces often don’t provide an inclusive environment for women, 
					trans and non-binary individuals to work in. The collective’s aim is to nurture the atmosphere in which all people feel 
					welcomed and can learn, expand their practises and share with the community.<br> 
					&emsp;&emsp;Another example of a contemporary collective is Maternal Fantasies. It is an interdisciplinary group of makers based in 
					Berlin, Germany. The collective focuses on shaping discourse on motherhood in the contemporary art creation. Their 
					methodology is creating workshops with the local community and using alternative ways of structuring art production, 
					such as children’s games or community-oriented experiments.<br>
					&emsp;&emsp;Both examples of collectives show the broad spectrum of goals and methods of acting as a group.

				<p>
					When we meet with a group of people, we usually have a common goal. Whether that is learning a new skill, doing 
					something for others or expanding your horizons, that collective factor helps the group connect and focus. While 
					it is useful to have that goal as a source of motivation, I believe that achieving it is not the most important 
					aspect of coming together. The focus should be put on the time shared with each other. Whether the goal has been 
					achieved or not, it matters if something has changed within the members of the group, if the process itself evoked 
					positive emotions.<br>
					&emsp;&emsp;In his essay <sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-8" href="#fn-8">[8]</a></sup> Walter Benjamin writes about the process 
					of crafting together. He believes that it is a process of conversing, storytelling, sharing knowledge and narrations. 
					Where there is a group of makers (listeners), there will also most probably happen to be a narrator (teller) among them. 
					According to Benjamin, once the listener’s hands become occupied with work, they can focus and listen more carefully to 
					the story told by the teller. After engaging with the story itself, the listener gets immersed in it, identifies with 
					it and starts to internalise it. If a story is told well, the listener has the urge to share it with other people—the 
					listener becomes the teller, and the cycle continues. In Benjamin’s essay, the storytelling is a factor that brings 
					everyone closer to each other. It encourages the participants to exchange stories and ideas, which instantly makes them 
					more active and curious about their closest environment. They become more engaged in other’s lives, encouraged to share 
					experiences, stories and advice. In her paper about “The Storyteller” by Walter Benjamin Esther Leslie <sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-9" href="#fn-9">[9]</a></sup>describes:
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<em>“Benjamin tells us, they gain audiences, lured into workshops to graft while netting experiences transmitted 
						from mouth to ear to mouth. The best listeners, insists Benjamin, are the ones who have forgotten themselves, 
						and while their half-conscious minds are engaged in pot-throwing, spinning and weaving, and their bodies are 
						seized by the gentle rhythm of work, the stories they hear forego an existence 
						on paper, imprinting themselves into the listener’s phantasy, awaiting retransmissions, after-lives.”  </em> 
				</p>

				<p>
					While the storyteller has an opportunity to engage everyone in the story, the listeners and the makers
					have an opportunity to fully let go of everyday matters and truly engage in the activity. They are captivated 
					with the story and the craft, which makes both their bodies and their brains fully occupied. Together they 
					create a group and make new memories. In <sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-10" href="#fn-10">[10]</a></sup> 
					Assmann and Czaplicka highlight the collective character of these memories:  
				</p>

				<p>
					<em>“Every individual memory constitutes itself in communication with others. These "others," however, are 
						not just any set of people, rather they are groups 
						who conceive their unity and peculiarity through a common image of their past.”  </em> 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					In this case the individuals compose memories that also belong to the group. And these common memories, 
					shared among the members of the group build up the sense of trust and belonging.  It makes the group 
					become emotionally engaged and, with time, attached to each other. While the storyteller is the one who 
					helps the group to connect, the craft is a way of bringing them together in the first place. This process 
					helps to create their collective identity. 
				</p>

				<h2 id="chapter-3">Hand to Hand</h2>

				<p>
					The newly created collective identity in this case refers to the “communicative” or “everyday memory” 
					<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-11" href="#fn-11">[11]</a></sup> , meaning oral history, with its 
					temporal characteristics. It’s contained within the group and its interactions. The shared narrative as
					well as the craft itself, are a part of the intangible cultural heritage which includes “non-physical 
					intellectual property including folklore, customs, beliefs, traditions, knowledge, and language 
					<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-11" href="#fn-11">[11]</a></sup>.” That’s why the importance of 
					preserving the traditional craftsmanship is high, since not only does it help us build communities 
					but is also key to maintaining our culture throughout the changing times. <br>
					&emsp;&emsp;The traditional craftsmanship finds many forms, such as toys, clothing, instruments or jewellery. 
					They are usually made from local materials and reflect the environment in which they were made and 
					their need for such an object. Some of these objects have a long-term function like a family heirloom, 
					while others are temporary. The level of the skills to create these objects vary as well. The more 
					intricate the material is, the longer it takes to learn and master the skill. <br>
					&emsp;&emsp;According to a ‘UNESCO’ article <sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-12" href="#fn-12">[12]</a></sup> 
					on the traditional craftsmanship, globalisation poses significant challenges to the survival of 
					traditional forms of craftsmanship. It states that mass production can offer needed goods at lower 
					cost both currency and time wise in comparison to hand production. Adrienne Rich writes about the 
					importance of maintaining these artifacts to continue the dialogue between different generations. 
					She describes:
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<em>
						“For spiritual values and a creative tradition to continue unbroken we need concrete artifacts, the work 
						of hands, written words to read, images to look at, a dialogue with brave and imaginative women who came 
						before us.” <sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-13" href="#fn-13">[13]</a></sup>
					</em>
				</p>

				<p>
					With such threats to the traditional craftsmanship, I believe it is important to put the effort in maintaining 
					these practices both for the sake of transferring tradition from generation to generation and decreasing the 
					negative impact the fast-paced production is causing to the environment.

				<p>
					From my personal experience it was always women around me that I build a special emotional connection with. 
					I felt their true engagement and observed sacrifices made for building special bonds. Growing up in a 
					female-dominated environment I observed my mother making connections with many women around her. During meetings 
					she created a space for others to feel accepted and understood. And as she helped others, she was also being 
					supported. All these women had different life situations and experiences. Some of them were mothers, some single, 
					living with friends or alone. Yet they all managed to connect and explore their diversity. The realities which 
					women often are confronted with either in a work environment or at home can be very difficult to deal with when 
					facing them alone. As Adrienne Rich <sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-13" href="#fn-13">[13]</a></sup> describes the 
					constant connection between women:
				</p>

				<p>
					<em>“Working together as women, consciously creating our networks even where patriarchal institutions are the ones in which 
						we have to survive, we can confront the problems of women’s relationships, the mothers we came from, the sisters with 
						whom we were forced to divide the world, the daughters we love and fear. We can challenge and inspire each other, throw 
						light on one another’s blind spots, stand by and give courage at the birth-throes of one another’s insights.”  </em>
				</p>

				<p>
					The relationship between women can spread throughout different groups and generations. It is an ever-growing network. 
					By following an example of such a network in Poland called “Rural Women’s Club” I would like to show how women took 
					initiative in spreading and strengthening the Polish culture and traditions and created a space for themselves to 
					feel supported in the difficulties of daily life. <br>
					&emsp;&emsp;According to article by I.Matysiak about the rural women’s organisations in Poland <sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-14" href="#fn-14">[14]</a></sup>, 
					the Rural Women’s Club (Koło Gospodyń Wiejskich) has first been started in the second half of the nineteenth century. 
					The source states that the club was founded to improve the living conditions in the countryside through creating centres 
					of support and education, as well as places of cultivating crafts, local tradition and health. As Matysiak writes, the 
					clubs were responsible for creating events and activities aimed at women to improve the agriculture and rural family’s 
					well-being, such as cooking classes, sewing clothes, embroidery or agriculture. <br> 
					&emsp;&emsp;An article about the circles of village housewives by Zajko-Czochańska <sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-15" href="#fn-15">[15]</a></sup> 
					states that during the partition of Poland into Russian, Prussian and Austrian parts in the late eighteenth century, 
					Poland disappeared from the map and at the end of the 19th century the hope for Poland’s independence rose among the 
					Polish nation, influenced by the growth of the rural community. All the nation’s efforts went into propagating the Polish 
					culture, education and prevention of the Russification and Germanification. According to Zajko-Czochańska in the 1877 the 
					first Rural Women’s Club began with the goal to gain back Poland’s independence and to maintain the cultural heritage. After 
					that the clubs started to spread, and right before the WW1 there were already a hundred clubs. The community grew bigger with 
					time reaching over 4200 Clubs until the 1938-1939 which meant around 99,5 thousand female members.  Despite political and social 
					hardships, the RWC has persisted, adapting to changing circumstances while maintaining its core mission since its beginning till 
					now and going through its revival since the beginning of the 21st century.  The article states that during some time of the Club’s 
					existence (especially during the socialist period) there were tries to use them for political propaganda to control the rural 
					population, but at the same time the clubs were viewed as ‘politically harmless’ being female structures. <br>
					&emsp;&emsp;Nowadays the Rural Women’s Club (RWC) is still an active organisation receiving government subsidies and counting many members. 
					Its form transformed since the schooling system became more accessible to all children, and women didn’t need that much help with 
					home-schooling and learning all the house tasks. Instead, the clubs became a way of connecting with the Polish culture and traditions 
					for the Polish community. The most popular activities of the clubs are workshops organised in many Polish cities and villages, teaching 
					traditional skills such as knitting, and organising festivals with live folk music and traditional family games. Nowadays a big emphasis 
					is also on sharing and archiving these traditions between the older and younger generation of women and other members of the clubs, so 
					that the Polish culture is preserved for the future. <br>
					&emsp;&emsp;I believe that the RWC helped women connect with each other through many different times and circumstances. Thanks to the club’s 
					activities the members could gain the feeling of empowerment by learning new skills and taking responsibility for the collective actions.
					 The women engaged in the clubs had the opportunity to step outside of the house and give themselves the time for connecting and processing 
					 the daily hardships of running a household. It also provided them with a space to connect on a deeper level with the Polish tradition 
					 and exchange knowledge. As described by Silvia Federici <sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-16" href="#fn-16">[16]</a></sup>:

						“In many parts of the world, women have historically been seen as the weavers of memory—those who keep alive the voices 
						of the past and the histories of the communities, who transmit them to the future generations and, in so doing, create a 
						collective identity and profound sense of cohesion. They are also those who hand down acquired knowledges and wisdoms—concerning 
						medical remedies, the problems of the heart, and the understanding of human behaviour, starting with that of men.” 
					</em>
				</p>

				<p>
					As stated by Federici, it was the women who were the ‘weavers of memory’, in constant connection with each other.<br>
					&emsp;&emsp;When looking into the stories of my family, I don’t have to search long to find women struggling in their households. 
					A few generations back it was a common practice for women to marry very early and submit to their husband’s will even 
					though it most often meant physical abuse. Heavy drinking, encouraged by subsidized vodka prices during Communism, has 
					compounded the violence, particularly in the countryside. As stated in a New York Times article <sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-17" href="#fn-17">[17]</a></sup>: “A recent survey 
					showed that 60 percent of families accepted corporal punishment as a way of scolding their children, a practice that 
					can carry over to violence against wives, sociologists say.” Women were completely controlled by the husband in terms 
					of daily life and work. The most common way of coping in those situations, was a strategy of verbally “agreeing” with 
					the husband while still trying to maintain one’s autonomy. The lives of these women were full of compromises and secrecy, 
					submitting to the husbands while at the same time trying to keep their own dreams and hopes alive. As described by Joanna 
					Kuciel-Frydryszak <sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-18" href="#fn-18">[18]</a></sup> in her book about the Polish countryside, a certain degree of flair or even cunning, were absolutely 
					essential qualities in the woman’s life. She wrote that keeping the husbands under the impression of having the power but 
					not resigning from their goals (especially making decisions about the children) was the only option. Not only did these 
					women plan the whole family’s future and managed the everyday tasks, but also tried to keep everyone happy at all costs, 
					especially the husband. That’s how the cycle continued, husbands taking care of the land, women taking care of the rest 
					and not getting any recognition for their efforts and overcoming endless struggles.<br>
					&emsp;&emsp;When writing about (house)work it expands more than only cleaning, doing the laundry, or cooking. (House)work also means 
					taking care of the atmosphere of the house, the well-being of all the residents as well as respecting all the cyclical 
					Polish traditions. It is the invisible work, the labour done ‘in-between’ bigger, more noticeable work. A big part of this 
					invisible work can be the emotional labour—making sure the kids get along, remembering and celebrating birthdays and special 
					occasions, sustaining family and non-family relations (quite often for all the members of the family)—doing all that with a 
					smile on her face. Women do it for the children, the husbands and themselves(!), to have a loving and happy home. But what 
					is the (personal) price, that they must pay for sustaining that peace and happiness?<br>
					&emsp;&emsp;Keeping up with traditions is another part of the responsibilities put on women’s shoulders. When it comes to the Polish 
					traditions, they vary from region to region, but they all serve similar functions. The most important ones are either to 
					‘protect’ or ‘prevent’ certain events from happening. An example of a protective decoration is a ‘spi-der’, which is a 
					meticulous construction made from straw, hanged from the ceiling in the middle of the room. Since it’s built from light 
					material it turns when someone walks through the room. This movement is supposed ‘clear the air’ and protect the family 
					from the ‘bad spirits’. <br>
					&emsp;&emsp;In the words of Adrienne Rich <sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-13" href="#fn-13">[13]</a></sup> about the women’s actions:
				</p>

				<p>
					<em>
						“Yet it is this activity of world-protection, world-preservation, world-repair, the million tiny stitches, the frictions 
						of the scrubbing brush, the scouring-cloth, the iron across the shirt, the rubbing of cloth against itself to exorcise the 
						stain, the renewal of the scorched pot, the rusted knife-blade, the invisible weaving of a frayed and threadbare family life, 
						the cleaning-up of soil and waste left behind by men and children.” 
					</em>
				</p>

				<p>
					&emsp;&emsp;Whenever all the (house)work was unmanageable, women would meet and help each other out—different generations of families and their 
					neighbours sitting together in a room making decorations, darning socks or preparing food. The women would talk and exchange stories. 
					That helped them build better relationships and engage in the life of others. Thanks to these women the Polish traditions and the 
					community stayed alive. 
				</p>

				<br>
				<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

				<p>
					&emsp;&emsp;While approaching the topic of collective crafting I decided to start from a very general overview of what this notion means to me. 
					By looking at my own relation to collectivity and belonging to a group, as well as making things with my hands and exploring how 
					engaging in different activities made me feel empowered, I slowly zoomed in to take a look at the profound emotional and relational 
					meaning of these processes. Another goal of this thesis was to expand on the role of women in collective activities and to explore 
					the importance of physical connection both in artmaking specifically, and human interactions in general.<br>
					&emsp;&emsp;When writing about the form of a group as a tool for deepening creative exploration, I engaged with the topic from a perspective of 
					being a creative maker myself. The process of creating a new work or researching a new topic can feel isolating and there can even 
					be a sense of powerlessness in this individual struggle. I became aware of the alternatives available around me—I believe that the 
					form of a collective makes it possible to maintain the creative freedom and allows to create a support structure, a net. Such structure 
					is weaved through time with multiple communities and individuals throughout life. From generation to generation, the different members 
					meet and mend the holes, make the structure whole again.<br>
					&emsp;&emsp;I saw writing this thesis as an opportunity to experience that ‘social net’ directly, within the context of my practice. My goal was 
					to make connections not only with the sources and writers mentioned above, but also (and maybe even more importantly) with people who 
					surround me in my daily life. During conversations with tutors, advisors and friends, I felt touched by noticing the possibility of 
					approaching relationships in a more inclusive way, especially in the context of women coming together. When reading texts by Adrienne 
					Rich, Audre Lorde or Silvia Federici, I felt like a part of a group, included in the discourse. I believe these collective structures 
					surrounding me are a proof of what powerful tool belonging to a closer group can be, and how their wisdom travels through generations.
